# Collateral for an AliExpress XCKU5P dev board

![Top view of the FPGA board](images/AliExpressXCKU5P-top.avif)

There is a bare-bones Kintex-US+ KU5P FPGA dev kit for sale on
AliExpress (with power, clock, and 1 GiB DDR4 SDRAM and little else).
As far as I can tell it doesn't have a name so I'll refer to it as the
AliExpressXCKU5P (I've seen many names for this, including ["FPGA
Development Board XCKU5P Core Board Ultra
XC7K325T"](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807736820342.html))

This repo reproduces (with permission from the seller) the associated
collateral.  My only change is renamed some chinese directories,
adding a few pictures, and this README.md.
